## Kubernetes/api Flag

## Nmap/frontend Flag

### Phase 1:
The network that your team VMs are within also contains a VM that is hosting a very popular (and secure!) banking service. 

Your objective for phase one is to access that banking service website.

HINTS:
* your VMs come with nmap pre-installed
* the command ```ip a``` will output network interface information for your VM
* use the following subnet mask in cidr notation for your scan: 255.255.255.0
* disregard output for other team VMs
* **the external IP of the banking service VM is appended to the VM's name. Replace the dashes with periods to have a valid ip address**

HOW TO SUBMIT FOR POINTS: 
	- Take a screenshot of the banking website homepage and copy/paste it into **your team's breakout room chat**

### Phase 2:
Congrats on gaining access to a very exclusive and innovative banking service. 

Your objective for phase two is to retrieve the flag from the website!

HINTS:
* Take some time to fully *inspect* the website (wink, wink)

* The console tab in your browser will be useful

HOW TO SUBMIT FOR POINTS:
	- Paste the flag output into **your team's breakout room chat**
